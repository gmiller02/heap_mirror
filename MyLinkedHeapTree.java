 * the website), but you will need 
 * to think about how to implement a CompleteBinaryTree such that
 * additions and removals operate *only* on the last node (hint: think
 * about other useful data structures). You must also ensure that you do not
 * violate the assignment runtime requirements when deciding how you will
 * track nodes within the tree.
